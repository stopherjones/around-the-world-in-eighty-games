    For our next stop, we're going to briefly double back on our route, stopping in Kenya, to celebrate the lives of Maasai warriors and boys in the recently released game, Elongo. 

    Kenya stands at the heart of East Africa, a land of sweeping savannas and dramatic highlands, from the snow-capped peak of Mount Kenya to the sunlit plains of the Maasai Mara. Kenyan people and traditions are deeply rooted in the land, from pastoral communities who have lived alongside wildlife for generations to bustling cities that pulse with creativity and ambition. 

    Elongo feels similar to Carcassonne and similar tile-laying / area control games. On the drought-affected plains under the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, young Maasai warriors and boys of two villages compete for valuable grazing land where they must shepherd zebu cattle, goats and sheep. They must use their guile and wits to plan their land capture and where necessary, steal the rights to land, and in this way, place all of their animals in the pastures.
    
    The warriors and boys must deal with dangerous animals, so they must stay close to their animals or build enclosures made of thorny acacia branches for their safety. But there are only 4 warriors and only 7 boys, and many animals to feed, so resources are scarce especially as boys are too small to look after zebu.
