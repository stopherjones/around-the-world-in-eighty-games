  Welcome to Denmark!
  
  We cross the border north into Denmark, and the city of Copenhagen, famed for its colorful facades and architectural beauty.
  
  More specifically, we’re going to Copenhagen’s famous Nyhaun harbour waterfront - originally a bustling commercial port, now a thriving social centre - as players attempt to construct new facades in a way that fits perfectly in with this picturesqueharbour scenery.
  
  Carefully pick your resources and ability tiles as you race to place tiles, trigger bonuses and complete your building as efficiently as possible.
