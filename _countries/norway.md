    Next up, we explore Scandinavia more broadly through two very different card games, as we go back in time to the Viking Era of 800 AD to 1050 AD - an age when Vikings explored, settled and raided across Northern Europe and even as far as Greenland, Canada and the Mediterranean. Often depicted as brutal invaders, Vikings were skilled craftspeople, often preferring to trade, albeit with a strong drive to fight for supremacy among tribes.

    First up is Herrlof, a trick-taking game where players compete to strengthen their tribe by secretly bidding how many tricks they will win and using special power cards to their best advantage.

    Knarr is a straight engine-building points race as players recruit Viking warriors, using their abilities to cumulate resources and explore locations in the first to the finish.
