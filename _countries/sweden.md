  Welcome to Sweden!
  
  We take the short hop across the Øresund Bridge to celebrate ‘Fika’ - an integral part of Swedish culture aimed at giving yourself a moment to have a break and socialise - usually over a coffee and a delicious treat!
  
  The custom of Fika can be enjoyed almost anywhere, thanks to Sweden’s generous right to roam public access and because the concept of Fika is ‘baked’ into many employment contracts ;-)
  
  But don’t be fooled by the cosy exterior, this is a clever two-player card battle, that requires planning and timing in order to play the right cards into your own café, while manipulating those of your opponent, in order to secure maximum points and win the round!
