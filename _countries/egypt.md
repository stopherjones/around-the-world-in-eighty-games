intro: |
    We continue heading north through Africa until we reach Egypt, one of the true cradles of civilisation. Here, the past feels startlingly present, colossal statues rise from the sands, ancient cities sleep beneath shifting dunes, and the great pyramids still cast their shadows just as they did thousands of years ago. Egypt is a place shaped by extremes, the lifegiving fertility of the Nile Valley and the stark silence of the Sahara; the grandeur of pharaohs and the humble rhythms of village life - all woven together into one of the world’s oldest and most enduring civilizations.

    We'll explore all of this history as we weave our way through the four games we'll play here - the the pyramids and their construction, Egyptian agriculture and the bustling marketplace. 

    Imohtep is a strategic construction game requiring careful planning and timing, as players load giant stones onto barges, then sail them to constuction sites to secure the best advantage
    
    Luxor has the feel of a family board game, as players wind their way around the board to the centre of the pyramid, all the while stopping to collect treasures before reaching the central sarcophagus.
    
    Nile is a card game in which players gather and plant crops, competing for vaulable fertile land, while managing the floods that inevitable arrive. 

    Sobek, another card game, sees players jostle for goods, employing various workers to boost their profits while setting their opponents back.
