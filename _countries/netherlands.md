  Welcome to the picturesque city of Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands.
  
  Known for its winding canals, historic architecture, and artistic heritage, Amsterdam is a city that effortlessly blends old-world charm with modern innovation. The Netherlands is a country of windmills, tulip fields, and a rich maritime history that once made it a global superpower during the Dutch Golden Age.
  
  Tulips became a symbol of the country after being introduced in the 16th century. During the Tulip Mania of the 1630s, tulip bulbs were so highly prized that they were worth more than gold, creating one of the first economic bubbles in history.
  
  Our next game celebrates Amsterdam’s famous Tulip Festival - Gift of Tulips is a clever card game in which you’ll gather and share tulips, gifting bouquets to your fellow players and the festival overall in an attempt to create the most beautiful display.
