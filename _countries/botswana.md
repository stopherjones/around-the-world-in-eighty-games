intro: |
    From the Sahara to the Kalahari next, and to Botswana, a rich and, fertile land famed for its vastness, its beauty and, of course, its wildlife.

    But Botswana is more than its wilderness. It is one of Africa’s most stable and forward-looking nations, rich in both natural resources and cultural heritage.

    Our next game takes us, quite literally, deep down to those resources, in the heart of the world’s largest diamond mine; Orapa Mine.

    Like a mashup between Reflection and Battleships, Orapa Mine is a game of deduction that sees players sending out ultrasonic waves in an attempt to be the first to discover the type and location of the gems hidden deep below the surface.
