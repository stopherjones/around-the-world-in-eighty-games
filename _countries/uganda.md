intro: |
    We head north from South Africa, following the vast Great Rift Valley, as it winds its way from Mozambique, through Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and finally to Ethiopia.

    The Great Rift Valley is one of the most extraordinary geological features on Earth - a vast scar where the African tectonic plate is slowly splitting in two - creating some of the largest and deepest lakes in the world, active and dormant volcanoes, and one of the most biodiverse regions on Earth. It contains savannas, tropical forests, wetlands, and alpine ecosystems all within relatively short distances.

    Our next game - Rift Valley Reserve - invites players to create the most impressive hiking trails within this vast region - plotting routes that navigate canyons, find the best wildlife and manage tent stops.
