    Our next stop takes us to South Africa, where the Atlantic Ocean meets the Indian Ocean at the Cape of Good Hope, where mountains rise above wild plains and modern vineyards, and where a mosaic of cities reflect a truly diverse, and often troubled, cultural history.

    However, it’s motorsport that takes us to the southernmost tip of this vast continent, and the famous Kyalami circuit - home to the South African Formula One Grand Prix 20 times across the 1960, 70, 80s and 90s, and where legends like Clark, Stewart, and Senna once chased glory beneath the African sun.

    Like all motorsports, Rallyman GT sees players balance speed, strategy and a healthy dose of ‘push your luck’ as they jostle around the track, rolling dice to manage their cars, block the racing line, and make it first to the finish!
