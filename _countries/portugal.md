    Portugal is a small but diverse country on Europe’s Atlantic edge, known for its rolling vineyards, golden beaches, and rugged cliffs. The Algarve, with its dramatic coastline and fishing towns, contrasts with the wilder mountains inland.

    Portugal is well known for producing cork, olives and, of course, Port wine, but perhaps nothing captures Portugal’s character more vividly than the glazed ceramic tiles known as Azulejos.

    Introduced through Islamic connections in the 15th century, these tiles evolved into a distinctly Portuguese art form, shifting from geometric patterns to elaborate scenes of history, faith, and daily life.

    Azul was a 2018 Spiel des Jahres winner and a staple of many board game meets and events. For this stop, we are playing the summer variant, but the objective of collecting and placing tiles to maximum effect remains the heart of the game.
