    If Germany was the spiritual home of modern board games, then our next destination, France, is very much the home of digital board games, being where BGA is based, and the thematic location for many, many modern games.

    The four games we will play in France aim to cover much of its beautiful countryside, historic towns and cities, and traditional culture and cuisine.

    In Fromage, we’ll step into the world of artisanal cheesemaking, crafting France’s most beloved delicacies.

    Carcassonne invites us to build medieval landscapes of fortified cities, abbeys, and winding roads.

    Castles of Burgundy takes us to the fertile vineyards and estates of the Loire Valley, where players develop their lands into prosperous domains.

    And in Oriflamme, we enter the cutthroat world of French noble houses, scheming for influence in a game of bluff and betrayal. Bon chance !
