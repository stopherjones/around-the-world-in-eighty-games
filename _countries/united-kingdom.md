  Welcome to London!

  We begin our journey around the world in the footsteps of Phileas Fogg, in London, a city with a rich board-gaming history, from one of the original versions of Monopoly, to more modern games like Scotland Yard and Get on Board. But for our first two games, we’re opening the boxes on a Turn-Based Arena favourite, Next Station: London, as well as something of a hidden deduction gem, Mr. Jack.

  In Mr. Jack you’ll step into the shoes of either a cunning detective or the elusive Mr. Jack himself, racing against time in a game of cat and mouse through the streets of Victorian London.

  Then, we’ll switch gears and head into the hustle and bustle of Next Station: London, a game that needs little introduction, where you’ll play the role of a transport planner, as you try to create the most efficient underground network across the city.
