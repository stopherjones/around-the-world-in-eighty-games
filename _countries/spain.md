    Spain is a country of striking contrasts, where Roman ruins, medieval fortresses, and modern cities all coexist in a landscape that stretches from green Atlantic hills to sun-drenched Mediterranean coasts.

    Few monuments reflect these contrasts as vividly as the Alhambra in Granada - a palatial fortress built during the 13th and 14th centuries, perched on a hill overlooking the city.

    In 2003 Spiel des Jahres winner, Alhambra, you will compete to grab the right currency and the hire best builders, as you attempt to recreate this architectural wonder, famed for its courtyards, intricate stucco work and flowing fountains.
