  Welcome to Germany - the spiritual home of modern board games!
  
  Germany has a deep-rooted board game culture, with a long history of traditional board games at the heart of family life, as well as being the birthplace of the ‘Eurogame’ genre, emphasising strategy, resource management, and indirect player interaction over luck or conflict - including, of course, popular ‘crossover’ games, Settlers of Catan and Carcassone.
  
  Germany is also the home of the prestigious board game award, the ‘Spiel des Jahres’ - so it is only fitting that we play 2006 winner, Thurn and Taxis - a game based in 16th century Germany, themed around the Thurn and Taxis family who revolutionised the postal system across Europe from their headquarters in Regensberg.
  
  This is a fast-paced, route-building game, where efficiency and timing are key for players to expand the length and breadth of their postal network ahead of the competition!
