intro: |
    We leave Europe, travelling south across the Mediterranean and to Africa and Morocco - a land steeped in history where desert sands meet rugged mountains - from the windswept dunes of the Sahara to the snow-capped Atlas peaks, Morocco is a country of breathtaking contrasts.

    At the heart of Morocco lies the marketplace, or souk, where carpets, spices, lanterns, and textiles overflow in dazzling displays. It is in this setting that our next game unfolds - in Marrakech, players step into the role of carpet traders, manoeuvering their wares across the bustling market floor while outwitting rivals in a contest of placement, negotiation, and luck.

    Moroccan is equally renowned for its diverse architecture: Berber Kasbahs sit alongside Islamic minarets, Moorish white stucco facades and French Art Deco buildings. In Medina players compete to rebuild the historic quarter located at the foot of the Atlas mountains.
