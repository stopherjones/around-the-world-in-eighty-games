    We leave Africa, crossing the Red Sea into Asia via Saudi Arabia and the city of Neom - one of the biggest and most controversial developments in a region that has become home to a series of ever bigger, ever more ambitious development projects across the Arabian peninsula.

    Neom is more than a city - it's a massive planned region covering roughly 26,500 square kilometres - larger than many small countries - intended to include smart cities, ports, research centres, entertainment zones and luxury tourism destinations. It's name blends neo (Greek for “new”) with mustaqbal (Arabic for “future”).

    The game of Neom is a futuristic city-planner, with players drafting and laying tiles to produce resources and develop their city in order to meet planning objectives.
