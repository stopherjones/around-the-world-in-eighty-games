    Welcome to Greece, a land steeped in history, mythology, and breathtaking beauty, known as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy and the Olympic Games.

    From the iconic whitewashed buildings of Santorini to the majestic ruins of the Acropolis in Athens, Greece has inspired art, philosophy, and culture for millennia - and, of course, our next two games:

    Santorini is something of a modern classic - a 2-player abstract with a twist. Channel the powers of Gaea, Zeus or even Chaos to build and climb to the top of the city, while manoeuvring to block your opponent.

    In Akropolis you’ll quarry for stone, while drafting and building housing, temples, markets, gardens and barracks, to grow your city and ensure it triumphs over your rivals.
