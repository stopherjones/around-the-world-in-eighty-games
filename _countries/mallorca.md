intro: |
    Mallorca is the largest of Spain’s Balearic Islands, a popular tourist destination for Europeans seeking year-round sunshine where rugged mountains meet turquoise seas, fishing villages and beautiful coves, cliffs and beaches.

    Mallorca is also steeped in agricultural history; its dry Mediterranean climate, with long hot summers and mild winters, makes it ideal for hardy crops like olives, almonds and figs, grown in traditional farmhouses known as Fincas.

    It is in these Fincas where we make our next stop, growing a range of produce on a windmill-shaped rondelles to fulfill the ever-changing demands of the produce markets around the island.
